        <p>The <strong class="text-gray-700 font-bold">KDB Higgins Mesenchymal Chondrosarcoma Research Fund</strong>
          has been established to support
          research that Kieran
          and Caz began working on together in 2022 at the University of Oxford, Nuffield Department of Clinical
          Neurosciences. “KDB Higgins” is Kieran’s academic name that he used in publications during his PhD.</p>

        <p>The purpose of the research is to understand more about the rare bone cancer Kieran had and to find new
          treatments. With Kieran’s background in software engineering/coding and Caz’s in molecular biology/cancer
          research they combined forces to untangle what drives the cancer cells and how to repurpose existing drugs to
          halt its growth. As only a few studies exist on this type of cancer, all findings are novel and potentially
          impactful for patients. The research group has collected over 150 cases of this rare cancer type from around
          the world and had begun their first set of experiments. Contributions towards this fund will enable further
          work to be done to benefit those with this rare and aggressive cancer. </p>
